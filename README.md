# nil benchmarking workflow

Issues faced : 
- I have an older Mac Air, which isnt strong enough for a virtual linux environment locally
- Attempted Oracle/AWS Linux instances but my verification couldn't go through due to current IP. My Card is american but visiting family in India right now
- Most other Linux servers online were't good enough to run the full toolchain together
- Ideally I'd like to have every single function working locally

Assumptions made : 
- I assumed the code for main and main-input are an instance of experiments aka test case
- When it mentioned calculate 'memory used', i assumed that implied 'useful-heap(B)'
- The assignment required printing memory/time. There was no mention of running the prove command 'scripts/run.sh --docker prove' so I skipped it.
